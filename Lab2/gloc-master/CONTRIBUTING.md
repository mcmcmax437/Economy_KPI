# Contributing to Transcriptase
We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

## We Develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
3. Issue that pull request!

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/kas-elvirov/gloc/blob/master/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](); it's that easy!
